# Agent Repo

LLM based agents can be powerful tools.  To put them to their highest and best use, it is helpful to design with the business, legal, and technical aspects in mind.

## Summary of Working Overview

# Transactional Agents

The summarized document, authored by Dazza Greenwood, provides a comprehensive analysis of legal considerations surrounding transactional AI agents. It defines these agents, outlines their key features, and explores various legal frameworks that apply to their use. The document then delves into specific scenarios across different domains, discussing potential legal issues, causes of action, and risk mitigation strategies.

# Section-by-section summary:


## 1. Definition of Transactional AI Agents:
This section defines transactional AI agents as systems designed to facilitate commercial transactions on behalf of human users. It outlines their key features, including goal complexity, environmental adaptability, and autonomous execution. Examples of such agents are provided, including online shopping assistants, travel booking agents, and automated bill payment systems.

## 2. Simple Diagrams for Each Example:
The document mentions the inclusion of simple diagrams illustrating the roles and transaction flows between the human user, the AI agent, and third parties for each example. 

## 3. The Legal Dimension:
This section discusses relevant legal frameworks, focusing on:

### 3.1 The Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA):
Explains how UETA provides a legal foundation for electronic commerce, including provisions addressing AI agents. Key definitions and sections are highlighted, such as those related to automated transactions, electronic agents, and the effect of errors.

### 3.2 The Wyoming Digital Identity Act:
Outlines this act's relevance to individual and organizational digital identity, incorporating UETA attribution provisions and laws against impersonation.

### 3.3 How UETA/ESIGN and Digital Identity Laws Apply:
Discusses the application of these laws to AI agents and human users, emphasizing the importance of attribution and error handling in commercial transactions.

## 4 How Current AI Agent Implementations Can be Configured to Support and Reflect these Existing Legal Frameworks:
This section provides guidance on configuring AI systems to align with legal frameworks, focusing on supporting attribution and error detection/correction.

## 5 Looking Forward:
Explores future considerations, including:
- Delegation of authority
- Agent-to-agent transactions
- Distinguishing between personal and vendor agents
- Teams of agents

# ISSUE SPOTTING FOR EACH TRANSACTIONAL AGENTIC AI SCENARIO

This extensive section provides detailed scenarios, potential causes of action, and risk mitigation strategies for various types of AI agents:

1. Online Shopping Agent
2. Travel Booking Agent
3. Appointment Scheduling Agent
4. Automated Bill Payment Agent
5. Project-Based Agents

For each type of agent, the document outlines specific legal issues such as authorization, contract formation, data privacy, consumer protection, and professional liability. It presents expanded fact patterns, possible causes of action, and risk mitigation strategies for each scenario.

For example, in the Online Shopping Agent scenario, issues like delegation of authorization, contract formation, and liability for unauthorized purchases are discussed. Causes of action might include claims against the AI provider for breach of contract or negligence, while mitigations could involve implementing clear delegation controls and user-friendly error correction interfaces.

The summarized document emphasizes the importance of implementing robust security measures, maintaining clear attribution mechanisms, and ensuring transparency in AI decision-making processes across all scenarios. It also highlights the need for user education and the implementation of oversight mechanisms to prevent legal issues arising from AI agent actions.
